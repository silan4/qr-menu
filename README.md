# QR-MENU 

# # In this project; By examining the general structure of the QR menus used in various businesses, I would develop a QR menu in a style that restaurants or cafes can use.

# Features of the Project :

# # The qr-menu I created has a fully responsive and dynamic page structure.
# # The QR menu consists of a homepage with all foods and drinks, a page with meals, and dynamic pages with every food or drink.
# # On the homepage;  By customizing the pictures, names, and information of the food and drinks, I created a front-end that appeals to the harmonious eye.
# # I created dynamic buttons and dynamic menu for a better user experience.
# #  You can click on the buttons with all, breakfast, lunch and drinks options and choose according to your wishes and make it easier to choose food and beverages with the relevant options.
# # You can click on the food and drink you intend to buy in the qr-menu where it uses a dynamic paging structure and take a closer look. After reviewing, you can click on the homepage icon and return to the homepage.
